# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 2, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started little projects to learn python syntax. I made a project to generate random numbers as a die. And a second project to guess a number from 0 to 1000 using binary search.

**Thoughts:** It's hard to find some project that animates me, the syntax seems silly to me. Even more when we do not use types, I feel lost.
