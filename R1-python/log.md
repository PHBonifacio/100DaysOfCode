# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started little projects to learn python syntax. I made a project to generate random numbers as a dice. And a second project to guess a number from 0 to 1000 using binary search. [link](https://github.com/PHBonifacio/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/R1-python/D1)

**Thoughts:** It's hard to find some project that animates me, the syntax seems silly to me. Even more when we do not use types, I feel lost.

### Day 2: June 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today, to feel a little less lost or unmotivated, I started to follow HackerRank tutorials and did simple exercises that helped to understand a little more of the language.. [link](https://github.com/PHBonifacio/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/R1-python/D2)

**Thoughts:** I still feel lost without variable typing and a little insecure with the lack of security / verification of the input data; but I still need to study execptions and everything.
