# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started little projects to learn python syntax. I made a project to generate random numbers as a dice. And a second project to guess a number from 0 to 1000 using binary search. [link](https://github.com/PHBonifacio/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/R1-python/D1)

**Thoughts:** It's hard to find some project that animates me, the syntax seems silly to me. Even more when we do not use types, I feel lost.

### Day 2: June 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today, to feel a little less lost or unmotivated, I started to follow HackerRank tutorials and did simple exercises that helped to understand a little more of the language.. [link](https://github.com/PHBonifacio/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/R1-python/D2)

**Thoughts:** I still feel lost without variable typing and a little insecure with the lack of security / verification of the input data; but I still need to study execptions and everything.

### Day 3: June 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today HackerRank suggested an exercise using classes, I felt a little lost in how a class is defined and I went looking for examples to understand better. It's a little different than he was used to using C #. [link](https://github.com/PHBonifacio/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/R1-python/D3)

**Thoughts:** I feel lost in the way you create a class, it seems silly to me; But they are barriers that I have to break. I felt bored doing simple exercises using loops.

### Day 4: June 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to take advantage of my lunch schedule to program something, but I spent more time downloading and configuring the environment than programming. [link](https://github.com/PHBonifacio/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/R1-python/D4)

**Thoughts:** Disappointed, I'll try to find some time to schedule the evening.
